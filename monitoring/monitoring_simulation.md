# Monitoring Simulation

This lab simulates basic monitoring similar to Zabbix.

Monitored items:
- Disk usage
- Free memory
- Apache service availability

Alerts are triggered when thresholds are exceeded
or when a service is not running.

This approach demonstrates understanding of
enterprise monitoring principles.
